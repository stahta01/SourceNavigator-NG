/*
 * $Log: net_event.cc,v $
 * Revision 1.1  2000/12/21 21:57:13  jrandrews
 * initial import
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2000/07/29 03:55:38  steve
 *  fix problem coalescing events w/ probes.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2000/05/31 02:26:49  steve
 *  Globally merge redundant event objects.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2000/05/27 19:33:23  steve
 *  Merge similar probes within a module.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2000/04/18 04:50:20  steve
 *  Clean up unneeded NetEvent objects.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2000/04/16 23:32:18  steve
 *  Synthesis of comparator in expressions.
 *
 *  Connect the NetEvent and related classes
 *  together better.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2000/04/12 20:02:53  steve
 *  Finally remove the NetNEvent and NetPEvent classes,
 *  Get synthesis working with the NetEvWait class,
 *  and get started supporting multiple events in a
 *  wait in vvm.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/04/12 04:23:58  steve
 *  Named events really should be expressed with PEIdent
 *  objects in the pform,
 *
 *  Handle named events within the mix of net events
 *  and edges. As a unified lot they get caught together.
 *  wait statements are broken into more complex statements
 *  that include a conditional.
 *
 *  Do not generate NetPEvent or NetNEvent objects in
 *  elaboration. NetEvent, NetEvWait and NetEvProbe
 *  take over those functions in the netlist.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/04/10 05:26:06  steve
 *  All events now use the NetEvent class.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/04/04 03:20:15  steve
 *  Simulate named event trigger and waits.
 *
