m4_bold([To what versions of QNX has DB been ported?])

m4_p([dnl
m4_db has been ported to the QNX Neutrino technology which is commonly
referred to as QNX RTP (Real-Time Platform).  m4_db has not been
ported to earlier versions of QNX, such as QNX 4.25.])])

m4_bold([Building m4_db shared libraries fails.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_path(/bin/sh) utility distributed with some QNX releases drops
core when running the GNU libtool script (which is used to build m4_db
shared libraries).  There are two workarounds for this problem: First,
only build static libraries.  You can disable building shared libraries
by specifying the m4_idef(--disable-shared) configuration flag when
configuring m4_db.])
m4_p([dnl
Second, build m4_db using an alternate shell.  QNX distributions include
an accessories disk with additional tools.  One of the included tools
is the GNU bash shell, which is able to run the libtool script.  To
build m4_db using an alternate shell, move m4_path(/bin/sh) aside, link
or copy the alternate shell into that location, configure, build and
install m4_db, and then replace the original shell utility.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([Are there any QNX filesystem issues?])

m4_p([dnl
m4_db generates temporary files for use in transactionally
protected file system operations.  Due to the filename length limit of
48 characters in the QNX filesystem, applications that are using
transactions should specify a database name that is at most 43 characters.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([What is the impact of QNX's use of m4_manref(shm_open, 2) for
shared memory regions?])

m4_p([dnl
QNX requires the use of the POSIX m4_manref(shm_open, 2) and
m4_manref(shm_unlink, 2) calls for shared memory regions that will later
be mapped into memory using m4_manref(mmap, 2).  QNX's implementation
of the shared memory functions requires that the name given must begin
with a slash, and that no other slash may appear in the name.])

m4_p([dnl
In order to comply with those requirements and allow relative pathnames
to find the same environment, m4_db uses only the last component of the
home directory path and the name of the shared memory file, separated
by a colon, as the name specified to the shared memory functions.  For
example, if an application specifies a home directory of
m4_path(/home/db/DB_DIR), m4_db will use m4_path(/DB_DIR:__db.001) as
the name for the shared memory area argument to m4_manref(shm_open,
2).])

m4_p([dnl
The impact of this decision is that the last component of all
environment home directory pathnames on QNX must be unique with respect
to each other.  Additionally, m4_db requires that environments use home
directories for QNX in order to generate a reasonable entry in the
shared memory area.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([What are the implications of QNX's requirement to use
m4_manref(shm_open, 2) in order to use m4_manref(mmap, 2)?])

m4_p([dnl
QNX requires that files mapped with m4_manref(mmap, 2) be opened using
m4_manref(shm_open, 2).  There are other places in addition to the
environment shared memory regions, where m4_db tries to memory map files
if it can.])

m4_p([dnl
The memory pool subsystem normally attempts to use m4_manref(mmap, 2)
even when using private memory, as indicated by the m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE)
flag to m4_ref(dbenv_open).  In the case of QNX, if an application is
using private memory, m4_db will not attempt to map the memory and will
instead use the local cache.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([What are the implications of QNX's mutex implementation using
microkernel resources?])

m4_p([dnl
On QNX, the primitives implementing mutexes consume system resources.
Therefore, if an application unexpectedly fails, those resources could
leak.  m4_db solves this problem by always allocating mutexes in the
persistent shared memory regions.  Then, if an application fails,
running recovery or explicitly removing the database environment by
calling the m4_refT(dbenv_remove) will allow m4_db to release those
previously held mutex resources.  If an application specifies the
m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) flag (choosing not to use persistent shared memory),
and then fails, mutexes allocated in that private memory may leak their
underlying system resources.  Therefore, the m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) flag
should be used with caution on QNX.])])
