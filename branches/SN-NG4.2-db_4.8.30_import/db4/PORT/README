This is a stripped down version of the dist/ directory, meant to automatically
build db4 under SN.

We need the following files:

Makefile.in
config.guess
config.hin
config.status
config.sub
configure
install-sh
ltmain.sh

Then adjust Makefile.in "install:" target to 

install: all

Finally remove all examples and docs subdirectories.
