i decided to fork sourcenavigator as it's been unmaintained for years.
the file TODO lists whats on my top-level agenda.


2003-02-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* config/acinclude.m4 (CYG_AC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG,
	CYG_AC_LOAD_TKCONFIG, CYG_AC_LOAD_ITCLCONFIG,
	CYG_AC_LOAD_ITKCONFIG): Subst TCL_DBGX into
	file paths so that TCL_DBGX does not need
	to be defined in extensions. This fixes
	the build when --enable-symbols is passed.

2003-02-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure: Regen.
	* configure.in: Check for broken Cygwin grep
	and generate an error if found.
	* config/acinclude.m4 (CYG_AC_PATH_TCLH,
	CYG_AC_PATH_TKH): Rework tests so they depend
	on $host instead of a hard coded check to
	see if CC is set to "cl".

2003-02-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* config.guess:
	* config.sub: Revert back to files released with
	Source-Navigator 5.1.2. The newer ones dropped
	support for the windows32 target and that broke 
	the install instructions.

2003-02-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* missing:
	* mkinstalldirs: Add files that did not get
	imported before, but are actually needed by libgui.

2003-02-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* COPYING:
	* ChangeLog:
	* Makefile.in:
	* config.guess:
	* config.sub:
	* configure:
	* configure.in:
	* install-sh:
	* config/acinclude.m4: Add acinclude.m4 from sources,
	but remove any macros that are not actually used.
	* itcl/*:
	* libgui/*:
	* tcl/*:
	* tk/*:
	* tix/*: Add bare bones toplevel configure, support
	files, as well as itcl, libgui, tcl, tk, and tix
	modules from sources.redhat.com CVS as of 2003-01-01.
	Tagged as SOURCES_IMPORT_2003_02_05.
