lawfully acquired a copy of the Source-Navigator software outside of the
United States within a jurisdiction which is a member of the European Community
(EC) subject to the Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs
dated May 14, 1991 (the "Directive"), you agree that within that jurisdiction
you will not, and will not allow any other party on your behalf, to attempt

Directive. Any and all information obtained during such lawful reverse

of the U.S., you agree that you will not re-export that software nor any
other technical data received from Cygnus, nor the direct product thereof,
except as permitted by U.S. law and the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction

the Source-Navigator software nor any other technical data received by
you from Cygnus, may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported
(i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia,
North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed
goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially
Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial
Orders. By downloading or using the Source-Navigator software, you are
agreeing to the foregoing, and you are representing and warranting that
you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident
of any such country or on any such list.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029365"></a>e. The availability
of the Source-Navigator software via Cygnus' website shall not be deemed
to constitute advertising in such countries where such form, manner or
method of advertising is prohibited by the laws of that foreign country.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029366"></a>2. TERMINATION. This
license is effective until terminated. You may terminate this license at
any time by (i) deleting the Source-Navigator software, and other data
made available or supplied to your by Cygnus, residing in electronic form,
(ii) destroying all tangible copies of the software and the accompanying
documentation, and (iii) certifying in writing, upon request by Cygnus,
that you have taken all of the foregoing actions. This license will also
automatically terminate immediately, without notice from Cygnus, if you
fail to comply with any term or condition set forth herein.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029367"></a>3. LIMITED WARRANTY.
If you are acquiring the Source-Navigator software on a program disk or
other tangible media, Cygnus warrants that the media on which your copy
of that software is furnished will be free from defects in materials and
workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the
date of receipt by you of that media. This warranty extends only to you
as the original end user licensee. Your exclusive remedy, and Cygnus' entire
liability, under this warranty will be the replacement of any defective
media. If Cygnus is unable to correct or replace the defective media within
a reasonable period after receiving your request, you may terminate this
license by returning your copy of the Source-Navigator software for a full
refund of the license fees paid. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS LICENSE, THE
SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AND LICENSED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, ARE EXCLUDED.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029368"></a>4. EVALUATION OR "DEMO"
VERSIONS. If the copy of the Source-Navigator software is being used by
you for evaluation purposes, you should be aware that this copy will operate
for no longer than the specified evaluation period. If you have obtained
a copy of the "DEMO" version of the Source-Navigator software, you should
be aware that this copy does not contain all of the features or functionality
of a full-featured version. You are responsible for backing up all of your
work created in connection with your use of such software. CYGNUS SHALL
IN NO WAY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNT OF THE
USE OF AN EVALUATION, "DEMO" OR FULL-FEATURED PURCHASED COPY OF THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR
SOFTWARE.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029369"></a>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
IN NO EVENT WILL CYGNUS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST
REVENUES, PROFITS, DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE, EVEN IF CYGNUS HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some states do not allow the
exclusion of incidental or consequential damages or limitations on how
long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you
may also have other rights that vary from state to state.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029370"></a>6. GOVERNING LAW. The
terms of this license shall be construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of California, excluding (i) that body of law known as conflicts
of law and (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale
of Goods.

<p CLASS="LicenseText"><a NAME="pgfId-1029371"></a>7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This license shall constitute the entire agreement between Cygnus and you
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements
or understandings between us, whether written or oral, with respect hereto.
No modification to this license shall be of any force or effect unless
made in writing signed by each party. You agree that you have not relied
on any representation in entering into this license other than those set
out herein.
