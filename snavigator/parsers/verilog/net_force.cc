 * Construct the procedural continuous assignment statement. This is a
 * bit different from a normal assignment because the the lval is only
 * intermittantly connected. The deassign in particular disconnects
 * the signals when they are not being assigned anymore. Because of
 * this, there is no other reference to the lval to make it stay put
 * so we increment the eref.

 * XXXX I'm not sure this is the right way. Perhaps I should create
 * output pins to connect to the netlist? But that would cause the
 * link ring to grow, and that is not quite correct either. Hmm...
