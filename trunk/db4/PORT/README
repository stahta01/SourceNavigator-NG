This is a stripped down version of the dist/ directory, meant to automatically
build db4 under SN.

We need the following files:

Makefile.in
config.guess
config.hin
config.status
config.sub
configure
install-sh
ltmain.sh


Then adjust Makefile.in "install:" target to 

install: all


To ensure the correct default build options, add the following into 
configure, after the checks for smallbuild:

db_cv_build_cryptography="no"
db_cv_build_hash="yes"
db_cv_build_queue="no"
db_cv_build_replication="no"
db_cv_build_statistics="no"
db_cv_build_verify="no"
db_cv_build_partition="no"
db_cv_build_compression="no"
db_cv_compat185="yes"


Finally remove all examples/, docs/ and perl/ subdirectories, and for each
removed directory place a REMOVED file in it.
