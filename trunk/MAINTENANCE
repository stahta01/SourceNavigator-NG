Subversion:

- commit messages must have a fully descriptive first line, used for changelog auto-generation
- invasive features (php parser fixes, windows build fixes et al) shall be done in a separate feature branch
- feature branches shall follow the scheme "SN-<base version>-<feature name w/ underscores>, as in "SN-NG4-phpv5_support"
- feature branches shall be fully merged before the next NG version cycle (to prevent too many conflicts)
- there shall be no back-merging, multi-merging nor merging trunk back into feature branches
- all fully merged branches shall be rm'ed from the repo afterwards


Changelog:

- is mostly auto-generated by using the following command

#> svn log -r <revision of last release>:HEAD | grep "^(" | grep -v "(INTERNAL"


- shall be updated only before releasing a new NG version, not after each commit


Mailing list:

- announce new NG versions including a short description of the changes
- ask for help for bigger bugs or win32 related stuff


Freecode.org:

- announce new versions with short changelog


Binary downloads configuration:

- 32bit Linux + win32 usually use CFLAGS="-O2 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer -march=i686"
